DE_Project steps to run 

Navigate to Source package where all the Python modules are.

Step 1 - Clone the repository in your local machine and install the dependencies using poetry 

poetry install


Step 2 - We need to create a Ratings Database where our Tables will reside .Run data_gen.py in poetry which creates a Database if not exists and Ratings table if not exists

poetry run python data_gen.py

The data_gen.py will also add the required saample/randm data into the Ratings table.

Step 3 - Run compute_aggregates.py using poetry that will contain monthly average ratings for products and stores it in a table RatingsMonthlyAggregates.

poetry run python compute_aggregates.py

Step 4 - Run top_products.py which will list three top-rated products for every month of 2024 in RatingsMonthlyAggregates table created in previous step.
poetry run python top_products.py

Step 5 - After executing all the development modules it is time to run the unit tests.

poetry run python -m unittest unit_tests/unit_tests.py










poetry run python truncate_table.py
Ratings Table Truncated successfully..!!
